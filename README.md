**The Brief**

This project required me to create a high school scheduling system that makes use of NPM, ReactJS, ExpressJS and my own API that contained the necessary information for the scheduling. The information on the website is all populated by the API data. There is a login system which determines which type of user that logs in, where students can view their classes and the teachers can edit the class information. 

**The Project**


This project assumes you have NPM. Before beginning, please make sure you have NPM correctly installed.

**You can check in the console by using:**

```
$ npm -v
```

You can download NodeJS at <https://nodejs.org/en/download/> <br>
This will automatically download NPM.
